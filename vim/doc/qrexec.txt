INTRODUCTION                                             *qrexec-introduction*

Whenever you edit Qrexec files, a set of scripts are defined to help you
write syntactically correct policies and configurations, lint the buffer and
do code completion.

Although the policy syntax is small, it takes one syntax error to break the
parser, denying every Qrexec call made after the occurrence until the mistake
is removed. With the vimfiles provided by this plugin, you can greatly
decrease the chances of breaking your inter-qube connections.

Available file types and directories where they are detected automatically:

- qrexecpolicy:~
        /etc/qubes/policy.d/*.policy
        /run/qubes/policy.d/*.policy
- qrexecpolicyservice:~
        /etc/qubes/policy.d/include/*
        /run/qubes/policy.d/include/*
- qrexecconfig:~
        /etc/qubes/rpc-config/*

The source code is available at https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-qrexec
and at https://github.com/ben-grande/vim-qrexec

OPTIONS                                                       *qrexec-options*

g:qrexec_recommended_style                        *g:qrexec_recommended_style*
        Type: |Number|, Default: `1`

        Enables or disables recommended style conventions. If enabled, the
        following options will be set: >
          setlocal expandtab tabstop=2 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 textwidth=78

<        To disable the recommended behavior, set the following variable in
        your |.vimrc|: >
          let g:qrexec_recommended_style = 0
<
LINT                                                             *qrexec-lint*

Several commands are provided that wrap the `qubes-policy-lint` executable.
Additionally, `qubes-policy-lint` can be invoked directly with |:make| or
dispatch.vim's ":Make" or by ale.vim's ":ALELint". ALE's main advantage over
the previous methods is that it saves the buffer to a temporary file to lint a
copy of the original, instead of saving the file in place to be linted,
avoiding an erroneous file being applied just because you want it to be
linted. All of the above methods utilize the |quickfix-window|.

If you want to lint a policy that is embedded into another file type, such as
Markdown fended code blocks, you can do so by linting the lines selected from
Visual mode: >
        :'<,'>w !qubes-policy-lint -
        :'<,'>w !qubes-policy-lint --include-service -

SYNTAX                                                         *qrexec-syntax*

The Qrexec parser is strict, so the syntax check must also be. The syntax
highlighting goal is to show errors, the valid highlighting is just a nice
side effect to help distinguish the fields and their data types.

Every rule has a minimum and a maximum number of fields. While the line
hasn't reached the least amount of fields, the last group is highlighted as
incomplete:
>
        # qrexecpolicy
        qubes.Example * @anyvm @default
                               ^------^

        # qrexecpolicyservice
        @anyvm @anyvm
               ^----^

        # qrexecconfig
        wait-for-session =
        ^---------------^
<
On the other side, if the maximum number of fields has been reached,
everything after it will be highlighted as an error:
>
        # qrexecpolicy and qrexecpolicyservice
        !include-dir directory/ example test
                                ^----------^
<
Duplicated parameters are also highlighted as an error:
>
        # qrexecpolicy
        qubes.Example * * * allow target=test autostart=no target=diff
                                                           ^---------^

        # qrexecpolicyservice
        * * deny notify=no notify=yes
                           ^--------^
<
The syntax check is extensive but not perfect, it might fail on some edge
cases where showing the error by highlighting would not be clear enough. To
better understand its limitations, search for "TODO" and "Limitations" in the
source code.

COMPLETION                                                 *qrexec-completion*

A completion function is provided. It can complete fields where there are
known values or by entries present in the current buffer. You can use
CTRL-X CTRL-U or CTRL-X CTRL-O during insert mode.  Consult |compl-function|
and |compl-omni| for more help.

Note that the completion based on the buffer entries will not verify the
syntax, it will only do a basic check, so if you inserted an erroneous item
on the file and the line reached the minimum number of fields, then the
erroneous item will also appear in the completion list. Make sure to first
correct all syntax errors before trying to complete an item.

SPELL                                                           *qrexec-spell*

The option 'spell' is enabled and 'spelllang' has the value "en_us,qrexec"
appended. If any spelling errors occurs but you consider them a good word, add
them to your 'spellfile'.

The spell file is only used for comments, as the syntax disables spell
checking in rules to not distract the reader's attention, as the rule fields
can't be spell checked.
